.TH SIMPLE_SHELL 1 "January 2025" "1.0" "Yoruan and Julio Simple Shell Manual"
.SH NAME
simple_shell \- A simple UNIX command interpreter created by Yoruan and Julio.

.SH SYNOPSIS
 ./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
The **simple_shell** is a simple UNIX command interpreter that mimics basic shell behavior. It runs in an interactive mode and executes basic commands by forking a child process and executing the command.

When you run the program, it will display a prompt and wait for you to type a command. The command is then executed, and the shell displays the prompt again after the command finishes. If an executable cannot be found, the program prints an error message and waits for the next command.

This shell supports only the following features:
- Displaying a prompt.
- Waiting for user input.
- Executing simple commands.
- Displaying an error message if a command is not found.
- Handling "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D).
- The program exits with status 0 when the user types **exit**.

.SH OPTIONS
No command-line options are available for **simple_shell**. The shell is invoked by running:
